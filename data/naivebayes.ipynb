We represent a message using a **binary** [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model. Specifically, a message is represented as a set of $k$ keywords, that is, $message = (w_1, ..., w_k)$, where $w_i = 1$ if the  keyword $w_i$ appears in the message and $w_i = 0$ otherwise.\n",

Don't let the name scare you, this model simply assigns probabilities to different counts of events with multiple outcomes. So for example: \"I roll a biased six-sided die six times, what is the probability that I get each side occurring exactly once\" is a question that can be answered with a multinomial distribution. You don't need to understand all of the equations on the Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
